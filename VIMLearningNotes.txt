Abdul's Notes for Learning VIM:
What is VIM?
	-
Why is learning VIM important?
	- 
Resource:

- open up terminal for Windows
- WSL 
- Key bindings are useful in other places too
- mouse is useless

Opening up a file with VIM:
	vim <filename>

Exiting vim:
	:q - gets you out of VIM
	:wq - saves, and then gets you out
	:q! - quits w/out saving
	:w - you would click this if you just wanted to 	save what you wrote to the file

The modal system:
Command Mode: J goes down, K goes up
What do 'h' and 'l' do?

If you want to type something, then you would go to insert mode. (Click 'i')

And then after you type something, you would then click 'esc'


To delete an entire line, you would click 'dd'
This gets rid of the entire line!

Going all the way down to the end of the file
'G'

Going back to the top of the file 
'gg'


If you want to go up or down across blocks of code, then you would click(or hold) the curly braces. 

'{' or '}'

Skipping a bunch of lines
You can use the hjkl keys and skip a number of lines
if you want to by putting the number in front of the character.

Example:
<number of chars> h | j | k | l
Will move you number of chars in that direction

Deleting a line, 'dd', and then if you want to undo that delete, then you would click 'u'

// what if I want to redo something?
Redo command:
	Ctrl + R
Undo:
	'u'
Copy and pasting lines of code:
	- 'yy' to copy the line
	- 'p' or 'P' to paste the code either on top or below
	- dd'ing a line automatically deletes it and then copies it to our clipboard

Deleting a certain number of lines of code:

<# of lines of code you want to delete> + 'dd'

The next important Mode:
Visual Mode:
	- This kinda allows you to highlight code and pick it
	- Capital V and then use the hjkl keys to navigate around to 
		edit your code and whatnot
	-
