Abdul's Notes for Learning VIM:
What is VIM?
	-
Why is learning VIM important?
	- 
Resource:
	<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiwGbcd8S7I>
- open up terminal for Windows
- WSL 
- Key bindings are useful in other places too
- mouse is useless

Opening up a file with VIM:
	vim <filename>

Exiting vim:
	:q - gets you out of VIM
	:wq - saves, and then gets you out
	:q! - quits w/out saving
	:w - you would click this if you just wanted to 	save what you wrote to the file

The modal system:
Command Mode: J goes down, K goes up
What do 'h' and 'l' do?

If you want to type something, then you would go to insert mode. (Click 'i')

A<adding something in>nd then after you type something, you would then click 'esc'


To delete an entire line, you would click 'dd'
This gets rid of the entire line!

Going all the way down to the end of the file
'G'

Going back to the top of the file 
'gg'


If you want to go up or down across blocks of code, then you would click(or hold) the curly braces. 

'{' or '}'

Skipping a bunch of lines
You can use the hjkl keys and skip a number of lines
if you want to by putting the number in front of the character.

Example:
<number of chars> h | j | k | l
Will move you number of chars in that direction

Deleting a line, 'dd', and then if you want to undo that delete, then you would click 'u'

// what if I want to redo something?
Redo command:
	Ctrl + R
Undo:
	'u'
Copy and pasting lines of code:
	- 'yy' to copy the line
	- 'p' or 'P' to paste the code either on top or below
	- dd'ing a line automatically deletes it and then copies it to our clipboard

Deleting a certain number of lines of code:

<# of lines of code y
<You want to delete> + 'dd'

The next important Mode:
Visual Mode:
	- This kinda allows you to highlight code and pick it
	- Capital V and then use the hjkl keys to navigate around to 
		edit your code and whatnot.
	- I think of this like a highlighter type of tool;
	- to exit out of Visual Mode, you would still press the 
		'esc' Key
- You can delete selected text and whatnot
- Ctrl R is redo

INSERTING A NEW LINE:
- if you want to insert a new line, then what you do 
- is you click 'o' and then it places you in that 
- new line.
- in this new line, you will be in insert mode (i mode)
Lets try it out: Insert a line below"
something
<Inserted something here>
somethingelse
Does it work?
yes

Capital O and Lowercase O differentiate
- there are a 10000 different ways to do something in VIM
- For example, if you wanted to delete an entire block of code
- You could click 'd' and then you can click '{'
- ^^ This would then delete the entire block of code

What is the best way to delete?
- 
How would one navigate horizontally?
- Going forward per word?
'w'
- Going backwards per word?
 'b'

 - Going to any line number:
 colon (:) + <line #> 
 This is how you get to any line number that you want
 to go to

Going to the beginning of a line:
- You would click the '^'
- this takes you to the first word basically 

If you want to skip through more words and such
- All you do is capitalize the W and the B and this will 
skip punctuation

if you want to go to a certain character or such
then you type of the character you type before + t

if you want to get to two connecting characters, you would
type in the % sign

Changing a word + Deleting a word:
click 'c' to change a word, and then 'dw' to delete a word

If you are at a certain character in the line, and you want to delete the 
rest of the line,  you would click capital "D"

^Everything to the right of your cursor^

Deleting to a certain letter/character:
'd' + 't' + <Character name>
this is how you get to that character
you could also do this by changing the 'd' to a 'c'
'c' + 't' + <Character name> (This would keep you in a certain mode)
				Geting to the next instance of a character:
you would click the character and then t, and then click ';'
This is how you would keep checking what the rest of the characters there 
are in the line
To get your cursor to be in the center of the page when you are typing,.
then you would click 'z'. This will bring you to the center

If you want to move over one cursor, and then be in insert mode
you would click 'a'. This would get you to the spot you want to edit

Capital 'A' gets you adding something at the end of the line
This is what you would click to get to the end of the line

Getting rid of one character only - 'x'
Swapping cases: clicking '~' swaps the casing of it

The Period Command:
The period command (.) simply does the last thing that you did
something
something
Repeated!
 
Replacing a character: 'r' and then type the char you want there!
